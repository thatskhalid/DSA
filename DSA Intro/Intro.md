### Data structures is how data can be stored in structures

Algorithms is how to solve problems, typically by search and manipulating these structures

Data is structured differenty depending on what data is present and what we want to do with them

Example: when determining who we are related to, we use a family tree
This is the most ideal data structure because it organizes everything chronologically and we can find who
we are related to easily

DS is important for creating powerful algorithms, because they help manage and organize data with reduced complexity and increased efficiency 

### 2 types of data structures

Primitive DS: basic ds that are provided by the programming language to represent simple data types like ints and floats

Abstract DS: High level ds which are built using primitive data types, they have more complex and specialized operations
